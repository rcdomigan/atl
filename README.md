I started re-writing in Rust, as you do [https://github.com/rcdomigan/atl-rs]

One day, I hope this will be A Typed Lisp; the ATL language.  For now it's a barely functioning and feature incomplete VM and byte-code complier, along with the detritus of a partially working interpreter which they are replacing.

The code is not now suitable for any purpose and is a a mess.  I'm bringing it into github so I can start at least using an issues tracker.
